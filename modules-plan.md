# Modules Section Plan

## Overview
This section will introduce students to JavaScript modules, teaching them how to split code across multiple files using real-world, engaging examples that students can relate to.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why code should be split into modules
- Learn import/export syntax
- Grasp the Single Responsibility Principle
- Practice creating and using modules effectively

## Chapter Breakdown

### 1. Introduction to Modules
- Why we need modules (using a social media app example)
- Problems with putting all code in one file (like having all your clothes in one big pile)
- Real-world analogies (organizing your digital music/photos into folders)
- Simple example: Building a playlist feature

### 2. Basic Export/Import Syntax
- Named exports using a recipe app example
  - Ingredients module
  - Cooking steps module
- Default exports
- Basic import syntax
- Exercise: Create a music playlist module

### 3. The Single Responsibility Principle
- What it means for a module to have a single responsibility
- Example: Breaking down a social media post feature
  - Post content
  - Comments
  - Reactions
- Exercise: Refactor social media features into modules

### 4. Working with Multiple Exports
- Using a streaming service example
  - Exporting different content types (movies, shows, music)
  - Different ways to import content
  - Renaming imports for clarity
- Exercise: Create content recommendation modules

### 5. Modules and Functions
- Using an e-commerce example
  - Shopping cart functions
  - Wishlist functions
  - Price calculations
- Exercise: Build shopping features as modules

### 6. Modules and Data
- Using a game inventory system
  - Items database
  - Player inventory
  - Shop inventory
- Exercise: Create and manage game inventories

### 7. Module Organization
- Using a photo sharing app example
  - Organizing filters
  - Managing user profiles
  - Handling comments and likes
- Exercise: Organize photo app features

### 8. Module Dependencies
- Building a chat application
  - Message handling
  - User status
  - Notifications
- Exercise: Create chat feature modules

### 9. Best Practices
- Real-world examples from popular apps
- When to split features into modules
- Naming conventions that make sense
- Exercise: Refactor app features

### 10. Final Project: Social Media Dashboard
Students will create a social media dashboard split across multiple modules:
- posts.js (creating and displaying posts)
- profile.js (user profile management)
- friends.js (friend lists and requests)
- notifications.js (notification system)
- feed.js (news feed management)

## Implementation Details
Each chapter will use Monaco editor's multi-file capabilities to show:
1. The feature module being built
2. The main app module using the feature
3. Live preview of how they work together

This gives students a clear visual of how modules work together in real applications they use every day.

## Technical Requirements
- Update Chapter component to support multiple Monaco editors
- Add file tabs or split view for multiple files
- Ensure test system can handle multi-file exercises
- Add preview capability for social media features

## Teaching Approach
- Focus on real-world applications students use daily
- Use examples from popular apps and platforms
- Show how modular code makes features easier to build
- Emphasize practical benefits over theoretical concepts
