  content: `## Glossary: 2D Arrays

This glossary contains important terms and concepts related to 2D arrays. Understanding these terms will help you communicate effectively about algorithms and data structures during interviews and technical discussions.

| Term | Definition | Week |
|------|------------|------|
| Algorithm | A step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. | 1 |
| Data Structure | A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data to suit a specific purpose. | 1 |
| Time Complexity | A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. | 1 |
| Space Complexity | A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. | 1 |
| Big O Notation | A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used to classify algorithms according to their growth rates. | 1 |
| O(1) | Constant time complexity - the operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size. | 1 |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic time complexity - the operation's time increases logarithmically as the input size grows. | 1 |
| O(n) | Linear time complexity - the operation's time increases linearly with the input size. | 1 |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic time complexity - common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort. | 1 |
| O(nÂ²) | Quadratic time complexity - often seen in algorithms with nested iterations over the data set. | 1 |
| Array | A data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. | 2 |
| Index | A numerical value used to identify an element's position within an array (usually zero-based in JavaScript). | 2 |
| Element | A single item stored in an array. | 2 |
| Length | The number of elements in an array. | 2 |
| Two Pointers | A technique that uses two references (pointers) to traverse an array or list, often moving at different speeds or directions. | 2 |
| In-place Operation | An algorithm that transforms input using no auxiliary data structure, though a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. | 2 |
| Subarray | A contiguous sequence of elements within an array. | 2 |
| Sliding Window | A computational technique that uses a window that slides through an array to track a subset of elements. | 2 |
| 2D Array | An array of arrays, creating a matrix-like structure with rows and columns. | 3 |
| Matrix | A rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. | 3 |
| Row | A horizontal line of elements in a 2D array. | 3 |
| Column | A vertical line of elements in a 2D array. | 3 |
| Grid | A network of lines that cross each other to form a series of squares or rectangles. | 3 |
| Neighbors | Adjacent elements in a 2D array (can be in 4 or 8 directions). | 3 |
| Cardinal Directions | The four main directions (north, east, south, west) used to find adjacent cells in a grid. | 3 |
| Diagonal Directions | The four diagonal directions (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest) sometimes used to find adjacent cells in a grid. | 3 |
| Bounds Checking | Verifying that indices are within the valid range of a 2D array to prevent out-of-bounds errors. | 3 |
| Traversal | The process of visiting each element in a 2D array, often in a specific pattern. | 3 |
