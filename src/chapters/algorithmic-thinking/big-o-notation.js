  content: `## Big-O Notation: Time vs Space Complexity

Big-O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it's used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

TBD

## Why Big-O Matters

Understanding Big-O notation is crucial for several reasons:

- It helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms
- It allows us to predict how algorithms will perform with large inputs
- It provides a language for discussing algorithm performance
- It guides optimization efforts by identifying bottlenecks
- It's a common topic in technical interviews

TBD

## Time Complexity

Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.

- It counts the number of operations performed by an algorithm
- It focuses on how the runtime grows relative to the input size
- It's expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(nÂ²))

TBD

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.

- It counts the amount of memory allocated by an algorithm
- It includes both auxiliary space and input space
- It's also expressed using Big-O notation

TBD

## Time vs Space Tradeoffs

Often, algorithms can be optimized for either time or space, but not both simultaneously.

- Faster algorithms may require more memory
- Memory-efficient algorithms may run slower
- The best choice depends on specific constraints and requirements
- Understanding these tradeoffs is key to algorithm design

TBD

## Analyzing Complexity

To determine the Big-O complexity of an algorithm:

1. Identify the basic operations
2. Count how many times each operation is executed
3. Express this count as a function of the input size
4. Keep only the highest-order term (drop constants and lower-order terms)
