  content: `## The 5-step Problem-Solving Process

Effective problem-solving in programming and algorithm development follows a structured approach. This 5-step process provides a framework for tackling complex problems systematically.

TBD

## Step 1: Clarify

The first step is to thoroughly understand the problem before attempting to solve it.

- Ask questions to eliminate ambiguities
- Identify the inputs and expected outputs
- Understand constraints and edge cases
- Restate the problem in your own words
- Consider example scenarios

TBD

## Step 2: Plan

Before writing any code, develop a clear strategy for solving the problem.

- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Outline the algorithm steps
- Consider multiple approaches and their tradeoffs
- Sketch pseudocode or flowcharts

TBD

## Step 3: Implement

Translate your plan into actual code.

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow programming best practices
- Implement one component at a time
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for clarity

TBD

## Step 4: Test

Verify that your solution works correctly.

- Test with example inputs
- Check edge cases (empty inputs, large values, etc.)
- Trace through the code manually
- Debug any issues that arise
- Verify the solution meets all requirements

TBD

## Step 5: Optimize

Improve your solution for efficiency and readability.

- Analyze time and space complexity
- Identify bottlenecks
- Refactor code for better performance
- Consider alternative algorithms or data structures
- Balance readability with performance

TBD

## Applying the Process in Interviews

This 5-step process is particularly valuable in technical interviews:

- It demonstrates structured thinking
- It helps manage time effectively
- It shows communication skills as you explain your approach
- It reduces the likelihood of missing important details
- It impresses interviewers with your methodical approach
