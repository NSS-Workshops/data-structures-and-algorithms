  content: `## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are the foundation of computer science and programming, providing structured approaches to problem-solving.

## Key Characteristics of Algorithms

- **Finiteness**: An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined and unambiguous.
- **Input**: An algorithm takes zero or more inputs.
- **Output**: An algorithm produces one or more outputs.
- **Effectiveness**: Each step must be basic enough to be carried out by a person using only pencil and paper.

TBD

## Why Algorithms Matter

Algorithms are essential in computer science and software development for several reasons:

- They provide efficient solutions to complex problems
- They form the basis of all computer programs
- They enable us to analyze and compare different approaches to solving problems
- They help us understand the limitations and capabilities of computing

TBD

## Examples of Common Algorithms

- **Sorting algorithms**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort
- **Search algorithms**: Linear search, binary search
- **Graph algorithms**: Breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm
- **Dynamic programming algorithms**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem
- **Machine learning algorithms**: Linear regression, k-means clustering, neural networks
