Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access and manipulation of data.

TBD

## Array Characteristics

- **Ordered collection**: Elements are stored in a specific order
- **Indexed access**: Elements can be accessed directly using their position (index)
- **Fixed size** (in some languages): Once created, the size cannot be changed
- **Homogeneous elements** (in some languages): All elements must be of the same type
- **Contiguous memory**: Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations

TBD

## Arrays in JavaScript

In JavaScript, arrays are dynamic and flexible:

- They can grow or shrink in size
- They can store elements of different types
- They are implemented as objects with special behaviors
- Indices are converted to strings and used as property names
- They provide numerous built-in methods for manipulation

TBD

## Common Array Use Cases

Arrays are versatile data structures used in many scenarios:

- Storing collections of related items (e.g., list of users)
- Implementing other data structures (stacks, queues)
- Representing matrices and grids
- Buffering data (e.g., reading file chunks)
- Managing sequential operations
- Storing and processing tabular data

TBD

## Arrays vs Other Data Structures

Understanding when to use arrays versus other data structures is important:

| Data Structure | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Arrays | Fast access by index, simple to use | Slow insertions/deletions in the middle |
| Linked Lists | Fast insertions/deletions | Slow random access |
| Hash Tables | Fast lookups by key | No inherent ordering |
| Trees | Hierarchical data, ordered operations | More complex implementation |
