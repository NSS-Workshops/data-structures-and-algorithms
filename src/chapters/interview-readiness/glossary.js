This glossary contains important terms and concepts related to technical interviews and problem-solving. Understanding these terms will help you communicate effectively during coding interviews.

| Term | Definition | Week |
|------|------------|------|
| Algorithm | A step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. | 1 |
| Data Structure | A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data to suit a specific purpose. | 1 |
| Time Complexity | A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. | 1 |
| Space Complexity | A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. | 1 |
| Big O Notation | A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used to classify algorithms according to their growth rates. | 1 |
| O(1) | Constant time complexity - the operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size. | 1 |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic time complexity - the operation's time increases logarithmically as the input size grows. | 1 |
| O(n) | Linear time complexity - the operation's time increases linearly with the input size. | 1 |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic time complexity - common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort. | 1 |
| O(nÂ²) | Quadratic time complexity - often seen in algorithms with nested iterations over the data set. | 1 |
| Array | A data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. | 2 |
| Two Pointers | A technique that uses two references (pointers) to traverse an array or list, often moving at different speeds or directions. | 2 |
| Sliding Window | A computational technique that uses a window that slides through an array or string to track a subset of elements. | 8 |
| Linked List | A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. | 4 |
| Stack | A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. | 5 |
| Queue | A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. | 5 |
| Map | A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique and maps to exactly one value. | 6 |
| Set | A collection of unique values with no duplicates allowed. | 6 |
| Binary Search | A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. | 7 |
| Sorting | The process of arranging elements in a specific order (usually ascending or descending). | 7 |
| Algorithmic Pattern | A general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in algorithm design. | 9 |
| Edge Case | A problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter. | 9 |
| Corner Case | A problem or situation that occurs outside normal operating parameters, specifically when multiple environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels. | 9 |
| Clarifying Questions | Questions asked to better understand the problem requirements, constraints, and expected outputs. | 10 |
| Problem Decomposition | Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. | 10 |
| Pseudocode | An informal high-level description of the operating principle of an algorithm, intended for human reading rather than machine reading. | 10 |
| Brute Force | A straightforward approach to solving a problem, typically by trying all possibilities until a solution is found. | 10 |
| Optimization | The process of improving an algorithm's efficiency or effectiveness. | 10 |
| Trade-off | A balance between competing factors in algorithm design, such as time complexity vs. space complexity. | 10 |
| Test Case | A specific set of inputs and expected outputs used to verify the correctness of an algorithm. | 10 |
| Whiteboarding | The process of solving a problem by writing code or diagrams on a whiteboard during an interview. | 10 |
| Code Review | The systematic examination of code by peers to identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to standards. | 10 |
| Clean Code | Code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. | 10 |
| Refactoring | The process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. | 10 |
| Debugging | The process of finding and resolving defects in software. | 10 |
| Technical Communication | The ability to clearly explain technical concepts, solutions, and trade-offs. | 10 |
| Behavioral Interview | An interview focused on past experiences and how a candidate handled specific situations. | 10 |
| System Design | The process of defining the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system to satisfy specified requirements. | 10 |
| Mock Interview | A practice interview that simulates a real interview environment. | 10 |
| Feedback Loop | The process of receiving and incorporating feedback to improve performance. | 10 |
